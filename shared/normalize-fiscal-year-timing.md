# Normalize Fiscal Year Timing

**Category:** General / Financial Analysis

## Purpose

When comparing financial data across companies, account for differences in fiscal year-end dates to ensure an apples-to-apples comparison.

## When to Apply

- Comparing quarterly or annual metrics across multiple companies
- Analyzing trends that span fiscal year boundaries
- Presenting time-series data from companies with different reporting calendars

## Common Fiscal Year-End Dates

| Company | FY End | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Apple (AAPL) | September 30 | Q1 = Oct-Dec |
| Microsoft (MSFT) | June 30 | Q1 = Jul-Sep |
| NVIDIA (NVDA) | January 31 | Q1 = Feb-Apr |
| Google (GOOGL) | December 31 | Calendar year |
| Amazon (AMZN) | December 31 | Calendar year |

## Implementation

1. **Identify and Disclose** — Always state fiscal year-end dates
2. **Align When Precision Matters** — Use TTM or calendar year aggregation
3. **Present Both Views** — Show fiscal and calendar alignment when helpful
